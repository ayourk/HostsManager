# HostsManager
GUI application to manage merging various different sources of HOSTS files

Developing this on Ubuntu Linux using VSCode.  This project uses Avalonia MVVM/ReactiveUI.
The goal of this project is to design an app that can import several HOSTS lists so as to combat ads.

The hostsman.py included here is a way for me to rapid prototype the C# app.
